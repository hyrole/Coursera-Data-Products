__Mortgage__ is a loan to finance the purchase of real property, normally use to buy a home. It is used by purchasers of to raise funds to buy real estate; or by existing property owners to raise funds for any purpose while putting a lien on the property being mortgage (Source: [Wikipedia: Mortgage Loan] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan)).

A mortgage is actually made up of several parts â€“ the collateral you used to secure the loan, your principal and interest payments, taxes and insurance.  

In this assingment, I will demonstrate a simple calculator to calculate _total repayment_, *total interest* and *monthly payments* based on *loan amount* and estimated current *interest rate* as well as *mortgage term in years* that will be presented in the UI Form.
